    "# Practical session: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Heart disease \n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions. It can help to:\n",
    "- identify obvious errors,\n",
    "- understand patterns,\n",
    "- detect outliers or anomalous events, \n",
    "- find relations among the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The \"target\" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains 14 columns that represent the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `age`: age\n",
    "- `sex`: gender: 1 - male, 0 - female\n",
    "- `cp`: type of chest pain (0 - typical angina; 1 - atypical angina; 2 - not angina; 3 - no symptoms\n",
    "- `trestbps`: resting blood pressure\n",
    "- `chol`: cholesterol\n",
    "- `fbs`: fasting glucose level\n",
    "- `restecg`: ECG (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal ST-T, 2 = according to the Estes standard, showing possible or definite hypertrophy of the left ventricle, severe condition)\n",
    "- `thalach`: maximum heart rate\n",
    "- `exang`: exercise-induced angina pectoris (1 - yes; 0 - no)\n",
    "- `oldpeak`: ST segment suppression caused by exercise relative to rest\n",
    "- `slope`: electro cardiogram of the heart at maximum load (1 = ascent, 2 = smooth, 3 = descent)\n",
    "- `ca`: the number of major blood vessels with a fluorescent color (0-4). Fluorescent color is mainly associated with diabetes\n",
    "- `thal`: a blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)\n",
    "- `target`: presence of heart disease in the patient (0 - no; 1 - yes)"
