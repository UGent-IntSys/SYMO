# Heart Disease Dataset

## Dataset

This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

## Features

This dataset contains 14 columns that represent the following features:

- `age`: age
- `sex`: gender: 1 - male, 0 - female
- `cp`: type of chest pain (0 - typical angina; 1 - atypical angina; 2 - not angina; 3 - no symptoms
- `trestbps`: resting blood pressure
- `chol`: cholesterol
- `fbs`: fasting glucose level
- `restecg`: ECG (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal ST-T, 2 = according to the Estes standard, showing possible or definite hypertrophy of the left ventricle, severe condition)
- `thalach`: maximum heart rate
- `exang`: exercise-induced angina pectoris (1 - yes; 0 - no)
- `oldpeak`: ST segment suppression caused by exercise relative to rest
- `slope`: electro cardiogram of the heart at maximum load (1 = ascent, 2 = smooth, 3 = descent)
- `ca`: the number of major blood vessels with a fluorescent color (0-4). Fluorescent color is mainly associated with diabetes
- `thal`: a blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
- `target`: presence of heart disease in the patient (0 - no; 1 - yes)
